			<h2>What is Plabs?</h2>
			<p>
				What most people call "Plabs" is actually the "Plabs Network", a routed internet
				based around an DMVPN-style encrypted on-demand meshing exchange network. 
				Plabs *itself* is the loose group of nerds that keep that network running and
				have fun (ab)using it.  But don't worry, even we call the Network "Plabs" because
				we're just as lazy as the next guy.
			</p>
			<h3>Okay, but what does that mean in practice?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						It's routed. That mostly means that we do not need to rely on NAT or similar. If
						you are a client in Plabs you get an IPv4 address all to yourself and every
						other IP in Plabs knows exactly how to get packets to you. This is really nice
						because we can for example use SIP without terrible hacks and work-arounds or
						can actually use UDP for *something* useful that's not a strict client-server
						schema.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It's a (partial) mesh.  This way there is no single point of failure. If a hop on the path
						you were using to get your packets to the destination goes offline the transient
						routers can instantly start using a different path. The absolute worst-case
						situation will result in less than 5 seconds of connectivity loss assuming there
						is at least one path remaining to your destination.
						It's not actually a mesh.  Normally in a mesh you need to explicitly set up
						connections to each node.  Plabs uses a few trusted bootstrap servers (called
						core-servers) that you register with.  These core servers establish trust with
						each endpoint allowing any node to a) bootstrap a mesh using the list of other
						registered nodes and b) establish trust to any node using a trust chain of a
						maximum length of 2.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It's encrypted.  All the connection going over the open Internet are encrypted
						using IPsec with some (hopefully) decent crypto.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
